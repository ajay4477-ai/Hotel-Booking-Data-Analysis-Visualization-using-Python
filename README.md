# Hotel-Booking-Data-Analysis-Visualization-using-Python
This project focuses on performing an end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on hotel booking data for AtliQ Hotels. The objective was to analyze booking performance, customer
behavior, and revenue trends across multiple cities and hotel categories using Python.
The analysis was conducted using multiple datasets.<br>

The project uses six datasets:<br>
fact_bookings.csv => Booking platforms information<br>
fact_aggregated_bookings.csv => Room categories information<br>
dim_hotels.csv => Hotel cities & categories information<br>
dim_rooms.csv => Room class information<br> 
dim_date.csv => Date information<br>
new_data_august.csv => New data of august month
<br>


Objectives :
1) Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
2) Explore booking platform performance
3) Analyze hotel category and city distribution
4) Identify revenue and occupancy trends
5) Generate business insights using data visualization
<br>


Key Analysis Performed:
1) Exploratory Data Analysis using .describe(), .value_counts(), and grouping techniques
2) Booking platform distribution analysis
3) City-wise and category-wise hotel performance evaluation
4) Revenue trend exploration
5) Visualizations using bar charts and statistical summaries
<br>

Libraries Used :<br>
Python<br>
Pandas<br>
NumPy<br>
Matplotlib
<br>


Project Outcome :<br>
This analysis provides valuable insights into booking trends, platform performance, and hotel distribution patterns. The findings can help hotel management optimize pricing strategies,
improve occupancy rates, and make data-driven business decisions.
